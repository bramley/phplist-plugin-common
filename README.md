# Common Plugin #

## Description ##
This plugin provides support classes required by my other plugins.
It also provides three pages which are added to the Config menu

* display the output of the phpinfo() function
* display the config.php file (user id and passwords are removed)
* display the contents of the php session

When installing or upgrading a plugin ensure that the latest CommonPlugin is installed as well.

## Installation ##

### Dependencies ###

This plugin is for phplist 3.0.0 and later.

Requires php version 5.4 or later.

The version of this plugin dated 2015-03-23 has an incompatible change. 
Other plugins that depend on CommonPlugin should be upgraded to their latest version.

### Set the plugin directory ###
The default plugin directory is `plugins` within the phplist `admin` directory but you can use a directory outside
of the web root by changing the definition of `PLUGIN_ROOTDIR` in config.php.
The benefit of this is that installed plugins will not be affected when you upgrade phplist.

### Install through phplist ###
The recommended way to install is through the Plugins page (menu Config > Manage plugins) using the package URL `https://github.com/bramley/phplist-plugin-common/archive/master.zip`.

In phplist releases 3.0.5 and earlier there is a bug that can cause a plugin to be incompletely installed on some configurations (<https://mantis.phplist.com/view.php?id=16865>). 
Check that these files are in the plugin directory. If not then you will need to install manually. The bug has been fixed in release 3.0.6.

* the file CommonPlugin.php
* the directory CommonPlugin
* the directory Common

Then click the small orange icon to enable the plugin.

### Install manually ###
Download the plugin zip file from <https://github.com/bramley/phplist-plugin-common/archive/master.zip>

Expand the zip file, then copy the contents of the plugins directory to your phplist plugins directory.
This should contain

* the file CommonPlugin.php
* the directory CommonPlugin
* the directory Common
